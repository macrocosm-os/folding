    The function takes a Protein and calculates the molecular dyanmics of it folding without further user input using the GROMACS molecular dynamics software.
    This is done in the following steps:

    1) Stabilizing the protein
    2) Stabilizing the protein in the evironment

    Notes:
    Gromacs is typically run from the command line with heavy user input, the goal of this function is to either skip
    the user input or use different servers to find the optimal input for us based on how "typcial" a run is for each protein

    Gromacs works best for proteins folded in water. Other solutions need a different workflow
    Given that this function makes generic names we may want to have each make a new folder with the proteins name?


    Inputs (main):
    protein_pdb: string arg for filepath of the .pdb file obtained from ___________
    ff: forcefield, this varies by protein and is the second most important input. This is a great use of distributed computed
        and different servers using different force fields is the most optimal way to find this.
    box: constrain the size of the simulated environment to reduce processing speed. Barring vastly irregular shapes,
        the rhombic dodecahedron is most optimal. This could be automated based on known size/shape of the protein or simply relgated to other servers
    energy_min_x: a .mdp file describing the energy minimizatoin parameters. This can be iterated upon based on validation results
        in the tutorial, energy_min_1=emin-charmm.mdp and energy_min_2=nvt-charmm.mdp, energy_min_3=npt-charmm.mdp, energy_min_4=md-charmm.mdp


    Inputs (optional, future):
    solution: Non-water solutions will require different molecular dyanmics functions and workflos
    verbose: Boolean descibing outputs for mdrun. If true, progress updates are ouput while dynamics are calculated
    output: necessary output depends on method of transition state calculations. This can be easily changed
