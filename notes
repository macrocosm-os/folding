THIS IS THE TUTORIAL I CHOSE TO DO 
    - https://tutorials.gromacs.org/docs/md-intro-tutorial.html
    - Notes: 
        - The simulation took 00:14:11:05 Minutes to minimise. 
        - I used the -v flag (verbose) such that it prints its progress to the screen at every step. NEVER  use this flag if run in background, on a HPC center or on a local cluster, it prints unnecessary data in the standard output file.
        -  `-deffnm` defines the file names of the input and output. 
        - `/workspace/folding/md-intro-tutorial/md-intro-tutorial-main/data/input/emin-charmm.mdp` this was the mdp file used. Note that `nsteps = -1` which means 'run as long as we need.'
        - Determining if the run was successful: potential energy Epot should be negative and for a simple protein in water, on the order of 100000 KJ/(mol nm). 
            - The run was indeed successful, we ended up with a potential energy around -600000 KJ/(mol nm)
